#Revision For Assessment 109 - Peer Interview#

##Main Aims##
* To achieve an A grade from the interview section of the assessment
* To impress the instructor with fluency of Ruby syntax as well as ability to use Ruby as a tool to problem-solve

##Criteria to Achieve Those Aims##
* Have a very thorough and fluent knowledge of Ruby syntax with respect to basic methods/concepts
* Be able to concisely explain my approach to solving a problem in words
* Understand and define (through vocalising) exactly how certain methods behave - e.g. what they return, if they take a block


##Potentially Weaker Areas##
1. Variable scope
2. Passing parameters into my own methods


##A Basic Plan##
1. Read through and take notes on "Introduction to Programming With Ruby"
2. Use the Ruby documentation and study syntax of Arrays, Hashes, Strings, Integers
3. Revise through all the sections that I have already passed to make sure everything is fully assimilated

##Final Run to the Assessment##
* Watch all the vides from series "Watching Others Code"
* Take notes and make sure everything contained in the videos is achievable with ease
