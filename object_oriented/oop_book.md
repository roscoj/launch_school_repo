#Object Oriented Programming Book#

##Introduction##

OOP was brought forth as a paragigm, to enable programmers to handle large programs; such programs,
if not written in an OOP style, are difficult or impossible to maintain - this is mainly due to the dependencies,
where a ripple effect can crash the whole program.

**Some definitions**

* Encapsulation: the act of hiding parts of the program so that the data contained cannot be modified without intent. It
is a form of data protection in this sense
* Polymorphism: 'poly' (many) and 'morph' (form). The ability of data to be represented as many different types
* Inheritance: An idea that a class can inherit behaviours of another class; a *superclass*
* Modules: these are mixed in with classes using the reserve word `include` which is known as a *mixin*
